1.  I write the cache when the first join happened. Without the caching,
    the data frame will be recalculate when using it next time, which spend
    more time.

2.  with .hint('broadcast'): 45s
    with .hint('broadcast') and disabling automatic broadcast join: 41s
    without the hint and disabling automatic broadcast join: 48s
    without the hint, letting Spark detect broadcast-able join: 52s
