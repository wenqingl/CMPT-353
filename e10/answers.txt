1.  (1) the reddit-0 data set and effectively no work
        9.10s user 0.64s system 186% cpu 5.220 total
    (2) no schema specified and not caching (on reddit-2 for this and the rest)
        18.28s user 0.73s system 154% cpu 12.296 total
    (3) with a schema but not caching
        15.43s user 0.67s system 164% cpu 9.757 total
    (4) with both a schema and caching the twice-used DataFrame
        16.66s user 0.91s system 206% cpu 8.493 total

2.  Most of the time taken to process the reddit-2 data set is in reading the files,
    since the schema and caching are all about reading data, and there are big improvement
    with them, which means reading data takes more time.

3.  Right before the join operation because the join operation needs two DataFrame, which 
    requires more time than one DataFrame operation.
