1.  When smoothing the CPU temperature, I think I got a better result with Kalman smoothing.
    Kalman smoothing works better at expressing trends. When the temperature rises and falls 
    in a short period of time, it can show the trend. However, LOESS will smooth out this trend.

2.  With accelerator, it's easy to know about the velocity. With gyroscope, it's easy to know the 
    direction. We could have a better prediction with these accurate data.
