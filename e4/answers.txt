1.  I think it is not a good way to predict population density,
    because the figure does not show any relationship between
    population density and daily temperatures. There is no pattern, 
    only a cluster between 5 to 30 degree.

2.  One reason is that we can read the compressed data directly with 
    Pandas and it will automatically decompress as needed. It may use
    some advanced algorithm to speed the process. Or, it could depends
    on the storage, like disk / memory .
