1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?
    In my opinion, the numpy is easier to work and read. I used numpy before and am not familiar with data frames or pandas. it spent time searching and familiar with function.

2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?
    pivot_months_pandas(data): 4.21 ms ± 18.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    pivot_months_loops(data): 104 ms ± 292 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
    The pivot_months_pandas(data) function is much faster than the pivot_months_loops(data) because the pandas does not use any loops. Using loop will traverse each element once, which will slow down the running speed.
